## goals ⚽️ 🥅
goals is a CLI tool that encourages you to set goals for youself and enables you to track these goals in the terminal. It can also be used as a habit tracker or a todo list.

## ⚡️ Quick start

First, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install **Go** if you haven't already.
> If you're looking for the **Create Go App CLI** for Go `1.16`, you can find it [here](https://github.com/create-go-app/cli/tree/v2).

Installation of `goals` is done by using the [`go install`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies) command. 

```bash
go install github.com/yuanb01/goals@latest
```
The binary should be installed to your `$GOPATH/bin` by default. To be able to call the `goals` binary from any directory in your terminal, you will need to add the directory where the binary is located to your PATH environment variable. For ex., I ran the following:

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
```

That's all you need to know to start! 🎉
